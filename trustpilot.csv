107,DuGood Credit Union,2022-04-14,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Take too long to clear a check before letting me set up my online banking. I wanted to move money from MN credit union but had to wait 9 days - then 2 more days to get account setup.  Seems like everything I did required a day or so to be approved.  Suggestion: Let me setup online banking immediately - just disallow withdrawals until the 9 days are complete -- would have allowed me to get everything in place and move money into the account much quicker. Hopefully when I set up Bill Pay and other features I don't have to wait again.

I gave her another valid card instead and was able to open a savings account. I hope next time that person is more aware of the facial expressions and body language they portray . I don’t intend to name the teller cause it reflects on the company as a whole. They are the face of the company thus they have to act accordingly."

My employer, Lake Charles Memorial Hospital, had been closed down, due to damages from the hurricane, as well. I had not worked in 3 weeks, close to a month. I needed help, in a hurry!I called for a loan. I was promptly, helped. The loan officer explained the benefits of a Home Equity Loan versus a Personal Loan. Kelli Meaux was extremely, knowledgeable, and helpful. She answered any, and all, questions, and concerns. I, later, contemplated the interest rates, but told Kelli that I had to reconsider the Home Equity, loan. I needed a Personal Loan, despite the differences in interest rates. Kelli was very, understanding. No, hard, feelings. Katrina Collins entered the picture. Katrina spoke with me, a few, times, on the phone. I gave her the information she needed. That same, afternoon, I received news that my personal loan was approved! The money was immediately placed into my account, for easy, access. Katrina and Kelli, as well as everyone, at DuGood Federal Credit Union are very, caring and compassionate.

881,DuGood Credit Union,2020-07-06,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I was contacted by Miss Stephanie at the Vidor brand to schedule an appointment to come in & sign paperwork on a vehicle that I had purchased.  When I arrived at the bank the lobby was closed, unless there to sign paperwork.  I was greeted at the door by another worker, who ask if I had a mask.  I informed her I was not aware I needed one.  She was so kind and went to get one for me.  She ask me to use hand sanitizer and took my temperature before I could see Miss Stephanie.  Miss Stephanie had all my paperwork ready to sign, she even took extra time to answer all my questions.  It was a very good experience."

I appreciate everyone in mortgage for helping me with the financing. I flooded previously and Tammy the manager at vidor kept me sane during the rebuilding of my flooded home.
